# Architecture

## Executive Summary
This is a Godot-based RPG game with scene-based architecture and global managers for state management. The project has been refactored from C++ to Godot, focusing on turn-based gameplay.

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Framework:** Godot 4.5
- **Language:** GDScript
- **Version:** 1.0

### Development Tools
- **Testing Framework:** GUT (Godot Unit Test)
- **Version Control:** Git

## Architecture Pattern
Scene-based architecture with autoload singletons for global state management.

### Key Components
- **Scenes:** UI and game scenes (.tscn files)
- **Scripts:** GDScript files for logic
- **Assets:** Images, fonts, audio in assets/ directory
- **Globals:** Autoload managers (GameManager, QuestManager, etc.)

## State Management
Uses Godot's autoload system for global state:
- GameManager: Core game state
- QuestManager: Quest tracking
- DialogueManager: Dialogue system
- StoryManager: Story progression
- CodexManager: Lore and codex

## Data Architecture
- No database required for this game
- Data stored in scene files and script variables
- Save/load functionality via Godot's built-in system

## API Contracts
- No external APIs
- Internal communication via signals and autoloads

## Security Architecture
- No web components, so minimal security concerns
- Local game data security via Godot's save system

## Performance Considerations
- Target: 60 FPS
- Optimized for desktop platforms
- Asset compression for smaller builds

## Deployment Architecture
- Export to multiple platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- No server deployment required

## Development Environment
- Godot 4.5 editor
- GUT for testing
- Git for version control

# State Management

## Overview

The project uses Godot's autoload system for global state management. Autoloads are singleton scripts that persist across scene changes.

## Autoload Managers

### GameManager
- **Path:** scripts/globals/GameManager.gd
- **Purpose:** Core game state management
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Game initialization
  - Scene transitions
  - Global game settings

### QuestManager
- **Path:** scripts/globals/QuestManager.gd
- **Purpose:** Quest tracking and progression
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Quest state
  - Objective completion
  - Quest rewards

### DialogueManager
- **Path:** scripts/globals/DialogueManager.gd
- **Purpose:** Dialogue system management
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Dialogue flow
  - NPC interactions
  - Dialogue state

### StoryManager
- **Path:** scripts/globals/StoryManager.gd
- **Purpose:** Story progression
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Story state
  - Chapter tracking
  - Narrative events

### CodexManager
- **Path:** scripts/globals/CodexManager.gd
- **Purpose:** Lore and codex system
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Lore entries
  - Codex unlocking
  - Information tracking

## Communication Patterns

- **Signals:** Used for event-driven communication between nodes
- **Direct calls:** To autoload managers for state changes
- **Scene changes:** Via GameManager for global state persistence

## Data Persistence

- **Save/Load:** Handled by individual managers
- **Format:** Godot's built-in serialization
- **Location:** User data directory (pyrpg-godot)

## Best Practices

- All global state changes go through managers
- Use signals for UI updates
- Keep managers focused on specific domains
- Test manager interactions thoroughly
